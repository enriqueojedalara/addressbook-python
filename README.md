Description
==================
This is an address book project, the project is divided in two parts, back-end and front-end. 

The back-end manage and process all data and is designed to be an horizontal scale-out application, also only 
"speak" JSON, so the server trafic is reduced.

The fron-end will manage all interactions with user (UI) and uses the back-end to consume/provide data, for this
I use Angular (Why?, just google a little and you will know why I choose it)
